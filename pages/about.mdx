# About Provably Safe AI

*provablysafe.ai* is collaborative website for the field and community of Safeguarded AI / Provably Safe AI.

## Objectives
- *Information hub*: aggregating public information on the field and community (papers, orgs, collaboration opportunities, events, â€¦)
- *Field introduction*: Providing onboarding pathway(s) for newcomers
- Foster collaboration and progress

## Collaboration methodology and governance

Your contributions are very welcome! For updates, enhancements, bug fixes, feedback:

- a) [Create a new issue](https://github.com/provablysafeai/website/issues/new); *or*
- b) Submit a pull request. The website is automatically published from the main branch to the domain.

The core maintainers periodically update the website, and process suggestions (issues and PRs) on Github.

The [*meta* channel](https://provablysafeai.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/428550-org.2Fprovablysafeai.2Fmeta) on Zulip enables for governance-level discussion for the project.

Caveat: Over the long-term, as per the research direction, a significant part of the R&D will plausibly involve collaboration within private secure environments which would not be public and therefore not be on a public website or forum.
