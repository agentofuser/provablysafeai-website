## Other Community Resources

- **safe-by-design** mailing list:
  - https://groups.google.com/g/safe-by-design
  - Started by [Atlas Computing Initiative](https://atlascomputing.org/) in
    collaboration with [FAR AI](https://far.ai/)
  - Publicly readable
  - "We have new users request to join rather than enabling joining directly to
    prevent spammers, but we're very welcoming!"
- **Formal Proof** tag on LessWrong:
  - https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/formal-proof?sortedBy=new
- The [Lean Prover](https://lean-lang.org/)
  [Zulip Chat](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) has a "Machine Learning for
  Theorem Proving" stream:
  - https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving
  - Conversations are mostly in the direction of applying machine learning to
    automate theorem proving, rather than applying formal methods to machine
    learning/AI safety, but progress in "AI4Math" is an important part of some
    "provably safe AI" proposals.
